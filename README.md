A movie recommendation is important in our social life due to its strength in providing enhanced entertainment. Such a system can suggest a set of movies to users based on their interest, or the popularities of the movies. Although, a set of movie recommendation systems have been proposed, most of these either cannot recommend a movie to the existing users efficiently or to a new user by any means. In this paper we propose a movie recommendation system that has the ability to recommend movies to a new user as well as the others. It mines movie databases to collect all the important information, such as, popularity and attractiveness, required for recommendation.
